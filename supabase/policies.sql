-- Humor Project: minimum RLS policies for profiles + avatar storage.
-- Paste into Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor -> New query -> Run.
-- Safe to re-run (drops and recreates the same policies).

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. public.profiles: each signed-in user can read and update only their row.
--    No INSERT policy: the auth.users trigger creates the row.
--    No DELETE policy: the app never deletes profiles.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
alter table public.profiles enable row level security;

drop policy if exists "Users can view their own profile" on public.profiles;
create policy "Users can view their own profile"
  on public.profiles for select
  to authenticated
  using ((select auth.uid()) = id);

drop policy if exists "Users can update their own profile" on public.profiles;
create policy "Users can update their own profile"
  on public.profiles for update
  to authenticated
  using ((select auth.uid()) = id)
  with check ((select auth.uid()) = id);

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Storage bucket "avatars" (public read via public URLs).
--    Skip this if you already created the bucket in the dashboard as Public.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
values (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  2097152, -- 2 MB
  array['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']
)
on conflict (id) do update
  set public = excluded.public,
      file_size_limit = excluded.file_size_limit,
      allowed_mime_types = excluded.allowed_mime_types;

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. storage.objects: users can only touch files under avatars/{their uid}/.
--    SELECT + UPDATE are needed for upsert (replace avatar.png in place),
--    SELECT + DELETE let the app remove an old avatar with another extension.
--    Anyone can still *view* avatars through the public bucket URL.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
